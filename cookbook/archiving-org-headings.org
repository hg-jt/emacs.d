#+TITLE: Archiving org-mode entries

* Problem

Org-mode raises an error when archiving entries:

#+BEGIN_verbatim
org-copy-subtree: Invalid function: org-preserve-local-variables
#+END_verbatim

* Solution

In some configurations, org-mode cannot find a function that it needs. The
workaround is to delete the compiled elc files. While non-ideal, this does
resolve the issue.

#+BEGIN_src sh
cd ~/.emacs.d/elpa
find org-plus*/*.elc -print0 | xargs -0 rm
#+END_src
